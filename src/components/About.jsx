          <p>
            I'm a Final year computer science student with a deep passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
            And currently, I am working As AI/ML intern at Frost Digital Venture(Frost and sullivan) Nepal. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into ML began with fascination about how machines can learn from data and make intelligent decisions.
            Through coursework and self-driven projects, I've gained hands-on experience in building and deploying 
            machine learning models. I'm particularly interested in  natural language processing, LLMs 
            and the practical applications of Artifical Intiligence in solving real-world challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in learning by building. Each project I work on is an opportunity to deepen my understanding 
            of ML algorithms, experiment with new techniques, and add a block in my journey. I'm actively seeking 
            Junior/Fresher roles where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced engineers, and make meaningful contributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding or training models, you'll find me reading research papers,Novels and participating in local community works
            or contributing to meaningful projects .
